We focused on the study of different mental health conditions and respondants’ favorite genres. Variables such as their age, hours a day, whether or not they play an instrument, compose, etc. were left out and not part of the analysis."

    "text": "Music has a big effect on how we live our lives, especially our mental health. In a study that collected data from a Google form, we seek to evaluate if there is a relationship between genres of music and whether or not they increase or decrease depression. The goal is to assist mental health professionals in recommending different types of genres to their patients, and figure out if there truly is one genre that is more beneficial than all of the others. We modeled depression, and it’s scale on 1-10 (1 being the respondent doesn’t experience it, 10 being the respondent experiences it often), as a logistic function of Gospel music and music effects. Gospel music seems to have little effect, however still decreases depression levels. The genre that is most associated with low depression rates and has the most likelihood to improve depression levels is Gospel music."

The participants were asked to measure their level of depression on a scale from 1-10, 1 being the lowest, and 10 being the highest.

While listening to gospel music frequently seems to have a little bit of an effect on lowering levels of depression, listening to lofi has no effect on increasing or decreasing depression levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI1\n\n\n\n\ngospel_freq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    gospel_freqRarely\n-0.01\n-0.61, 0.58\n\n\n    gospel_freqSometimes\n0.09\n-0.77, 0.98\n\n\n    gospel_freqVeryfrequently\n-1.0\n-2.6, 0.59\n\n\nlofi_freq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    lofi_freqRarely\n0.49\n-0.06, 1.0\n\n\n    lofi_freqSometimes\n0.53\n-0.06, 1.1\n\n\n    lofi_freqVeryfrequently\n0.02\n-0.69, 0.79\n\n\nmusic_effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    music_effectsNoeffect\n-0.48\n-1.0, 0.05\n\n\n    music_effectsWorsen\n2.3\n0.88, 3.7\n\n\n\n1 CI = Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, there is no definite genre that listening to increases or decreases depression levels, though listening to the gospel genre might make a bit of an effect. This may be because of the religious ties to gospel music, which generally connects people and helps them mentally.\nLike every bayesian regression model, this model is not completely accurate in that it was only sent out on a couple social media platforms (Reddit, Discord, other social media), which doesn’t include data from people not involved online, and was advertised on posters and business cards (which restrict the data to a certain proximity)."
