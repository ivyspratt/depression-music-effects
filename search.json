We focused on the study of different mental health conditions and respondants’ favorite genres. Variables such as their age, hours a day, whether or not they play an instrument, compose, etc. were left out and not part of the analysis."

In a study that collected data from a Google form, we seek to evaluate if there is a relationship between genres of music and whether or not their listeners have high or low levels of depression. The goal is to better understand the correlation between music genres and depression, and possibly evaluate any trends between the two. We modeled depression, and it’s scale on 1-10 (1 being the respondent doesn’t experience it, 10 being the respondent experiences it often), as a logistic function of Gospel music and music effects. Gospel music seems to have little effect, however still decreases depression levels. The genre that is most associated with low depression rates and has the most likelihood to improve depression levels is Gospel music, reporting that people who listen to it often have 1.0 level of depression lower than others."

    "text": "Average effects of all genres on depression\nTo answer the question of which genre is the best to listen to, we first have to see which of the favorite genres are most associated with high/low levels of depression, by using a bayesian regression model. For this initial model, we are using this formula:\n\\[\ndepression_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} fav\\_genre_i\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI1\n\n\n\n\nfav_genre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    fav_genreCountry\n0.23\n-1.2, 1.7\n\n\n    fav_genreEDM\n1.0\n-0.24, 2.3\n\n\n    fav_genreFolk\n1.0\n-0.30, 2.4\n\n\n    fav_genreGospel\n-1.5\n-4.1, 1.0\n\n\n    fav_genreHiphop\n1.7\n0.48, 3.0\n\n\n    fav_genreJazz\n0.41\n-1.1, 1.9\n\n\n    fav_genreKpop\n0.23\n-1.2, 1.7\n\n\n    fav_genreLatin\n0.45\n-3.9, 4.7\n\n\n    fav_genreLofi\n2.5\n0.55, 4.6\n\n\n    fav_genreMetal\n0.98\n0.01, 2.0\n\n\n    fav_genrePop\n0.40\n-0.56, 1.4\n\n\n    fav_genreR&B\n-0.25\n-1.5, 1.0\n\n\n    fav_genreRap\n-0.08\n-1.5, 1.4\n\n\n    fav_genreRock\n1.2\n0.29, 2.1\n\n\n    fav_genreVideogamemusic\n0.40\n-0.78, 1.6\n\n\n\n1 CI = Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that on average, gospel listeners generally have lower levels of depression, while lofi listeners generally have higher levels of depression.\nLike every bayesian regression model, this model is not completely accurate in that it was only sent out on a couple social media platforms (Reddit, Discord, other social media), which doesn’t include data from people not involved online, and was advertised on posters and business cards (which restrict the data to a certain proximity).\n\n\nAverage effects of gospel music on depression\nTo give us a baseline of how listening to gospel music impacts your depression levels, we evalute it alone so we can evaluate how much lower gospel listeners’ depression levels are. We do that by taking the frequency of how often people listen to Gospel music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI1\n\n\n\n\ngospel_freq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    gospel_freqRarely\n0.06\n-0.50, 0.62\n\n\n    gospel_freqSometimes\n0.06\n-0.82, 0.94\n\n\n    gospel_freqVeryfrequently\n-1.0\n-2.5, 0.56\n\n\n\n1 CI = Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, there is no definite genre that listening to increases or decreases depression levels, though listening to the gospel genre might make a bit of an effect. Although, since Gospel listeners on average might have lower depression levels, the only conclusion we can make is that Gospel listeners, on average, have the lowest levels of depression."
