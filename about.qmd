This project explores the effects of music on depression levels. The participants were asked to measure their level of depression on a scale from 1-10, 1 being the lowest, and 10 being the highest. Here is the [Github repository](https://github.com/ivyspratt/depression-music-effects).

This project was created as a part of [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
