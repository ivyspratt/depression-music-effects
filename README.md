Here is the [website link](https://ivyspratt.github.io/depression-music-effects/) via github pages.

This project evaluates the relationship between different music genres and level of depression among indidivuals. It comes from a survey published online via Google Forms with many respondents, you can see it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results). It's found that although listeners of Gospel music have the lowest levels of depression, it seems to have little effect in decreasing the depression level when studied using a regression model.
